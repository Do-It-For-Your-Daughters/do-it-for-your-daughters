            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Hi, My name is Siyavuya Dlomo. I am the founder of Do It For Your Daughters, this is my message.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ever heard someone say “she was asking for it” or “boys will be boys”? Kinda gross, right? You’d hope we’d all be past that by now. But the truth is, we’re not. Those exact words are still thrown around like it’s nothing. Women are still being blamed for the actions of men. Still walking home with keys between their fingers. Still being told how to dress, how to act, how to be careful — instead of teaching men how to respect.
                <br>
                <br>
                So where does it come from? This behaviour. This mindset. It’s learned. It’s the silence when your friend makes a “joke.” It’s the way a guy gets praised for “scoring,” while a girl gets shamed for speaking up. It’s in households, schools, churches, songs, movies — it’s everywhere. A boy is taught to “man up,” but never taught to stand up for someone else. It’s passed down in comments, in silence, in systems that protect men more than they protect women.
                <br>
                <br>
                And that’s why Do It For Your Daughters exists. This isn’t just a name or a catchy phrase. It’s a wake-up call. A reminder. A push for change. If you wouldn’t want your own daughter, sister, mom, or friend to go through this — why stay quiet when someone else’s does?
                <br>
                <br>
                This account is not about blaming men. It’s about calling men in. Holding each other accountable. Realising that even if you’ve never laid a hand on a woman, the minute you laugh at the joke, stay silent during the story, or defend your boy for “just being drunk,” you become part of the problem.
                <br>
                <br>
                Accountability doesn’t mean being perfect. It means trying. It means learning. It means speaking up when it’s uncomfortable. Checking your friend. Relearning what you thought was okay. Saying, “That’s not funny,” even if everyone else laughs.
                <br>
                <br>
                And yeah, this is going to make some people uncomfortable. Good. Comfort is what got us here. The truth is, women are tired. Tired of fighting alone. Tired of explaining, of proving, of surviving. It’s time we showed up — not with flowers after the damage is done, but with action before it even happens.
                <br>
                <br>
                This page is about having the hard conversations. Saying what needs to be said. For the women who’ve been silenced, ignored, blamed, and broken. For the girls growing up who deserve better. For the boys who still have time to learn. And for the men who are ready to stop being bystanders.
                <br>
                <br>
                Because if you really care about the women in your life — then do it for them. Do it for your daughters.
