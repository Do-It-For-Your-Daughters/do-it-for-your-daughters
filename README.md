# do-it-for-your-daughters

Do It For Your Daughters is a digital platform designed to spark real conversations, challenge toxic norms, and inspire accountability — especially among men — in the fight against gender-based violence, misogyny, and systemic silence.

## 🌍 About the Organization

Ever heard someone say *“she was asking for it”* or *“boys will be boys”*? Yeah — we’re tired of it too.

The truth is, we’re still living in a world where women are blamed for the actions of men. A world where girls grow up being taught to protect themselves, but boys aren’t always taught to respect. That needs to change - and that change starts with all of us.

Do It For Your Daughters isn’t just a name — it’s a wake-up call. A reminder that if you wouldn’t want your daughter, your sister, your partner, or your friend to go through something — then why stay silent when someone else does?

This platform is here to:
- Call men in, not out.
- Spark hard conversations.
- Promote action over silence.
- Encourage learning, unlearning, and accountability.
- Create a world that’s safer and more equal for the next generation.
